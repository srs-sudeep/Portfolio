## About Me

I'm [Sudeep Ranjan Sahoo](https://srssudeep.vercel.app/), a freelancer and self-taught developer from India. I'm passionate about building things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.
